# FirewallController

Ryu controller application that blocks traffic in real time and wait for user's decisions. Specifically, every new traffic in the network will be blocked and will wait for user decisions (block or accept that kind of traffic). A new rule will be automatically added in the switches involved in the network managed by the controller. Furthermore the user can also see precisely all the rules installed in the network devices and manually add new configurations at any time.  

##  How it works
Based on Ryu component-based framework, we created five modules (in modules folder) to be loaded through run.sh.
### my_fileserver.py
It creates a server that answer user's request to certain URLs: like this, we realize a Web GUI, through which a user can send request to the controller application.
### tap.py
It realizes the "manual" part of the app. In fact this module is the core for the management of the manual add of rules in the network devices.   
### tap_rest.py
It maps, through WSGI, each request from the Web GUI to tap.py.
### live.py
It realizes the "real time" part of the application. In fact this module provides methods to live interact with network devices installed in the network. With this, user can decide if allow or deny a new kind of traffic found in the network. 
### live_rest.py
It maps, through WSGI, each request from the Web GUI to live_rest.py.

Note: all the interactions between user and ryu application are provided by Javascript/JQuery scripts that you can find in the /web/js folder.

## Tests

In the folder tests, there are two shell scripts that will let you emulate two different network, to test how this controller application works. Try communicating between those two computers using different protocols and see how this controller application behaves.

## Docs

Inside folder docs, you can find some documents, where all the files in this repository, among many other things, are described in detail, if you are interested.
